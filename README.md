modify_crontab
==============

modify_crontab provides a simple way to modify your crontab via a script.

I found that I have created many different crontab modification via scripts
and felt it was time to create a utility that could do it already.

The plan is to make the script portable between linux and solaris, but for
now it's solaris.
